## üß™ Testing Strategies

### Mock vs Real API Testing
- **Development Phase:** Use mock responses for rapid iteration
- **Integration Testing:** Real API calls with small data sets
- **Performance Testing:** Cached responses for consistent measurements

### Error Scenario Testing
- **Invalid JSON:** Malformed request bodies
- **Missing Required Fields:** Incomplete data structures
- **API Rate Limits:** High-volume testing scenarios
- **Network Timeouts:** Slow response simulation

### Validation Testing
- **Schema Compliance:** Ensure responses match expected structure
- **Data Type Validation:** Verify correct data types in responses
- **Business Logic Validation:** Check calculated fields and derived values

## üìà Performance Test Data

### Small Scale Tests (Development)
- Product Catalog: 1-5 products
- Report Sections: 2-3 sections
- Document Batch: 1-3 documents

### Medium Scale Tests (Staging)
- Product Catalog: 10-20 products
- Report Sections: 5-10 sections
- Document Batch: 5-15 documents

### Large Scale Tests (Production Simulation)
- Product Catalog: 50-100 products
- Report Sections: 10-20 sections
- Document Batch: 20-50 documents

- Completely malformed text input
- Empty or null requests
- Requests that exceed API limits

## üìù Best Practices

### Data Consistency
- Use consistent naming conventions across all test scenarios
- Maintain realistic data relationships (e.g., dates, amounts)
- Keep test data updated with current information

### Demonstration Flow
- Start with simple examples to build understanding
- Progress to complex scenarios gradually
- Always include error handling demonstrations

### Audience Adaptation
- **Executive Audiences:** Focus on business value and ROI examples
- **Developer Audiences:** Include technical edge cases and error scenarios
- **Mixed Audiences:** Balance business context with technical depth
