Test with negative sentiment:
```
http://localhost:8080/api/products/generate/review?productId=TECH-123&sentiment=negative
```

## 5. Generate Product Features

**Request URL:**

```
http://localhost:8080/api/products/generate/features?productType=laptop&featureCount=4
```

**Expected Response (Sample):**
```json
[
  "16GB RAM and 512GB SSD storage",
  "4K Ultra HD display with anti-glare coating",
  "12-hour battery life",
  "Lightweight aluminum chassis at only 2.8 pounds"
]
```

## 6. Generate Product Properties

**Request URL:**
```
GET http://localhost:8080/api/products/generate/properties

Great question! While using LLMs to generate hallucinated product descriptions makes for good demonstrations, there are several practical real-world applications for structured output conversion in Spring AI:

## Real-World Applications of Structured Output in Spring AI

### 1. Knowledge Base Integration & RAG
- **Customer Support**: Convert unstructured support documentation into structured FAQs or troubleshooting guides
- **Technical Documentation**: Transform detailed API documentation into structured reference objects that developers can easily consume
- **Legal Document Analysis**: Extract structured entities (clauses, parties, terms) from legal contracts using RAG

### 2. Data Transformation & Enrichment
- **Data Cleaning**: Process messy user-inputted data and convert it into standardized, structured formats
- **Content Enrichment**: Enhance existing product data with additional metadata, tags, or categorizations
- **Language Translation with Structure Preservation**: Translate content while maintaining the original structured format

### 3. Business Intelligence Applications
- **Report Generation**: Convert raw business data into structured reports with insights
- **Data Summarization**: Generate structured summaries of long documents or datasets
- **Trend Analysis**: Extract structured trends from market reports or user feedback

### 4. User-Generated Content Processing
- **Review Analysis**: Process customer reviews to extract structured sentiment, key points, and product attributes mentioned
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Convert unstructured social mentions into structured data about brand perception
- **Survey Response Analysis**: Transform open-ended survey responses into categorized, structured insights

### 5. Enterprise Integration
- **Legacy System Integration**: Convert outputs from legacy systems into modern API-compatible structured formats
- **Cross-Platform Data Exchange**: Ensure data consistency across different systems with standardized object mapping
- **API Response Transformation**: Convert varied API responses into a consistent format for your application

### 6. Specific Industry Examples
- **Healthcare**: Extract structured patient data from clinical notes
- **Finance**: Generate structured financial analysis from market reports
- **E-commerce**: Convert product descriptions into structured attribute lists for better searchability
- **Manufacturing**: Transform technical specifications into structured comparison tables

The key advantage of Spring AI's structured output converters is that they create a clean separation between:

1. The LLM's natural language processing capabilities
2. Your application's strongly-typed data model

This allows you to leverage AI's strengths in understanding and generating natural language, while maintaining the type safety, validation, and structure that enterprise Java applications require.

Unlike simple demos, in production environments you would typically combine these techniques with:
- Proper input validation
- Output verification and quality control
- Business rule enforcement
- Integration with existing domain models and databases
